# A-Star-algorithm-in-OpenGL
Implementation of the A star search algorithm using C++ and OpenGL.
-- Project for the course Computer Graphics in FINKI.

The program starts with a white grid.
When the program is running - first LEFT mouse click (yellow square) is the - starting point, 
second LEFT mouse click (blue square) is the - ending point,
the following LEFT mouse clicks - barrier(s).
If a black barrier square is clicked with the RIGHT mouse button - it deletes the barrier(square).

WHEN clicked SPACE - the algorithm starts & finds the shortest path from the starting to the ending point.

WHEN clicked ENTER - it restarts the grid.
